Python None
===========

Python defines a special object called the None object or Python None that represents an empty value. The None object is returned by functions and methods that do not have a return value. The None object has no value and prints as None. For example


.. code-block:: python

    >>> a = [1, 3, 7, 5] 
    >>> print a.sort()
    None
    >>> import sys 
    >>> x = sys.path.append('.')
    >>> print x
    None
